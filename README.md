# GoogleCardboard_Networked_Shooter Project Specification
Team Members: Anissa Alexander, Anthony Maina, Christina Wang, Michael Umenta

We are making an up to 3-4 multiplayer, networked laser tag game in Unity for the Google cardbaord. One phone is the network host. 
Each player will be trying to make the most points in given timespan. 

Features: Menu to select diffculty and join room to wait for other available players. MUST be on the same WIFI network. 

Actions: 
1. WALKING: Players can move by angling the google cardboard down and looking in the direction they want to go. This 
is our own modified version of the built in character controller. 
2. SHOOTING: Players can shoot by pressing the trigger button
3. BOMBS: there are various bombs set ups that must be avoided. Bombs can be shot to trigger an explosion
4. Capture Flag: There is a flag object that can be collected for extra points at the end of the game. It respawns if the carrier is killed.

Assets sources: Most assets are from the unity asset stores and some assets have been slightly modified by our team.
